# Azure Functions with Event Hubs Trigger (TypeScript)

A TypeScript Azure Functions QuickStart project that demonstrates how to use an Event Hubs Trigger with Azure Developer CLI (azd) for quick and easy deployment. This sample showcases a real-time news streaming system with automated content generation and intelligent processing.

## Architecture

This architecture shows how the Azure Function processes news articles through Event Hubs in real-time. The key components include:

- **News Generator (Timer Trigger)**: Automatically generates realistic news articles every 10 seconds and streams them to Event Hubs
- **Azure Event Hubs**: Scalable messaging service that handles high-throughput news streaming with 2 partitions
- **News Processor (Event Hub Trigger)**: Executes automatically when news articles arrive, performing sentiment analysis and engagement tracking
- **Azure Monitor**: Provides logging and metrics for function execution and news analytics
- **Downstream Integration**: Optional integration with other services for search indexing, push notifications, or analytics

This serverless architecture enables highly scalable, event-driven news processing with built-in resiliency and automatic scaling.

## Top Use Cases

1. **Real-time News Processing Pipeline**: Automatically process news articles as they're generated or updated. Perfect for scenarios where you need to analyze sentiment, detect viral content, or trigger notifications when new articles arrive without polling.

2. **Event-Driven Content Management**: Build event-driven architectures where new content automatically triggers downstream business logic. Ideal for content moderation workflows, search index updates, or social media distribution systems.

## Features

- Event Hubs Trigger with high-throughput news streaming (180-270 articles/minute)
- Azure Functions Flex Consumption plan for automatic scaling
- Real-time sentiment analysis and engagement tracking
- Optional VNet integration with private endpoints for enhanced security
- Azure Developer CLI (azd) integration for easy deployment
- Infrastructure as Code using Bicep templates with Azure Verified Modules
- Comprehensive monitoring with Application Insights
- Managed Identity authentication for secure, passwordless access

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 22.x or later](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools)
- [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
- [Azurite](https://github.com/Azure/Azurite) for local development
- An Azure subscription

### Quickstart

1. **Clone this repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MadhuraBharadwaj-MSFT/functions-quickstart-typescript-azd-eventhub.git
   cd functions-quickstart-typescript-azd-eventhub
   ```

2. **Make sure to run this before calling azd to provision resources so azd can run scripts required to setup permissions**

   Mac/Linux:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ./infra/scripts/*.sh
   ```

   Windows:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
   ```

3. **Configure VNet settings (optional)**

   You can choose whether to enable VNet integration:

   For simple deployment without VNet (public endpoints):
   ```bash
   azd env set VNET_ENABLED false
   ```

   For secure deployment with VNet (private endpoints):
   ```bash
   azd env set VNET_ENABLED true
   ```

   > **Note:** If you don't set `VNET_ENABLED`, the deployment will ask you to make an explicit choice.

4. **Provision Azure resources using azd**

   ```bash
   azd provision
   ```

   This will create all necessary Azure resources including:
   - Azure Event Hubs namespace and hub
   - Azure Function App (Flex Consumption)
   - Application Insights for monitoring
   - Storage Account for function app
   - Virtual Network with private endpoints (if `VNET_ENABLED=true`)
   - Other supporting resources
   - `local.settings.json` for local development with Azure Functions Core Tools, which should look like this:

   ```json
   {
     "IsEncrypted": false,
     "Values": {
       "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
       "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node",
       "EventHubConnection__fullyQualifiedNamespace": "your-eventhubs-namespace.servicebus.windows.net"
     }
   }
   ```

   The `azd` command automatically sets up the required connection strings and application settings.

5. **Start the function locally**

   ```bash
   func start
   ```

   Or use VS Code to run the project with the built-in Azure Functions extension by pressing F5.

6. **Test the function locally by watching the automatic news generation**

   The News Generator will automatically start creating articles every 10 seconds. You should see console output like:

   ```
   [2024-11-10T10:30:15.123Z] Successfully generated and sent 5 news articles to Event Hub
   [2024-11-10T10:30:15.145Z] ✅ Successfully processed article NEWS-20241110-A1B2C3D4 - 'Breaking: Major Discovery in Renewable Energy Technology' by Sarah Johnson
   [2024-11-10T10:30:15.147Z] 🔥 Viral article: NEWS-20241110-E5F6G7H8 - 8,547 views
   [2024-11-10T10:30:15.149Z] 📊 NEWS BATCH SUMMARY: 5 articles | Total Views: 18,432 | Avg Views: 3,686 | Avg Sentiment: 0.34
   ```

7. **Deploy to Azure**

   ```bash
   azd up
   ```

   This will build your function app and deploy it to Azure. The deployment process:
   - Checks for any bicep changes using `azd provision`
   - Packages the TypeScript project using `azd package`
   - Publishes the function app using `azd deploy`
   - Updates application settings in Azure

8. **Test the deployed function by monitoring the logs in Azure Portal:**
   - Navigate to your Function App in the Azure Portal
   - Go to Functions → NewsGenerator or EventHubsTrigger
   - Check the Monitor tab to verify both functions are working
   - Use Application Insights Live Metrics to see real-time news processing

## Understanding the Code

This sample contains two functions that work together:

### News Generator (Timer Trigger)

Runs every 10 seconds and generates 3-8 realistic news articles, then sends them to Event Hubs. The key configuration:

- **Timer**: `*/10 * * * * *` (every 10 seconds)
- **Output**: Event Hubs output binding to "news" hub
- **Articles**: Realistic content with authors, sources, categories

### News Processor (Event Hubs Trigger)

Triggered automatically when articles arrive in Event Hubs. Performs sentiment analysis and engagement tracking. The key environment variable that configures its behavior is:

- `EventHubConnection__fullyQualifiedNamespace`: The Event Hubs namespace endpoint

These are automatically set up by azd during deployment for both local and cloud environments.

Here's the core implementation of the Event Hubs trigger function:

```typescript
app.eventHub('EventHubsTrigger', {
    connection: 'EventHubConnection',
    eventHubName: '%INPUT_EVENTHUB_NAME%',
    cardinality: 'many',
    handler: async (messages: unknown[], context: InvocationContext) => {
        // Handle both single event and list of events
        for (const message of messages) {
            const newsArticle = message as NewsArticle;
            // Process news article with sentiment analysis and engagement tracking
        }
    }
});
```

## Networking and VNet Integration

This sample supports optional VNet integration with private endpoints for enhanced security.

### Configuration

Set the `VNET_ENABLED` environment variable before deployment:

For simple deployment without VNet (public endpoints):
```bash
azd env set VNET_ENABLED false
```

For secure deployment with VNet (private endpoints):
```bash
azd env set VNET_ENABLED true
```

When `vnetEnabled=true`, the deployment creates:
- Virtual Network with three subnets (app integration, storage endpoints, Event Hub endpoints)
- Private endpoints for Storage (blob, table, queue) and Event Hubs
- Private DNS zones for name resolution
- Network isolation with public access disabled

The VNet deployment takes longer (~4-5 minutes) but provides enhanced security suitable for production workloads.

### VNet Architecture

When VNet integration is enabled, the following network architecture is created:

#### Subnets
1. App Integration Subnet: For Function App VNet integration
2. Storage Private Endpoints Subnet: For Storage Account private endpoints
3. Event Hubs Private Endpoints Subnet: For Event Hubs private endpoints

#### Private Endpoints
- Storage Account: Blob, Table, and Queue private endpoints
- Event Hubs: Namespace private endpoint

#### DNS Configuration
- Private DNS zones are automatically created and linked to the VNet
- Ensures proper name resolution for private endpoints

### Security Considerations

When using VNet integration:
- Public access to Event Hubs and Storage is disabled
- All traffic flows through private endpoints within the VNet
- Client IP must be added to Event Hubs network rules for local development (done automatically by post-provision scripts)
- Managed Identity is used for authentication between services

## Clean Up Resources

When you're done testing the sample, you can delete all Azure resources to avoid incurring charges:

```bash
azd down
```

This will:
- Delete all Azure resources created by `azd provision`
- Remove the resource group
- Clean up the local environment configuration

> **Note:** This action is irreversible. Make sure you no longer need the resources before running this command.
